# Labs

Here are my programs for laboratory work that I write during my studies (oh, and it's my first repository). (Modifying the ReadMe file).
All labs were written in C#. Visual Studio 2022 was used in a console application and .NET 8.0.



To run it, you need to download the repository to your device. You can do this by entering the following command in Git: "git clone https://github.com/T-two-K/Labs.git" or by installing the project zip archive (green "Code" button).



Next, you can run it in the already installed Visual Studio or in Git. If you decide to run it via Git, here are the necessary commands:

1\. cd Labs/directory-name-in-which-the-lab-you-are-interested-in-is (file with the .csproj extension)

2\. dotnet restore

3\. dotnet build

4\. dotnet run

If step 4 doesn't work, try this:

dotnet run --project ProjectName.csproj
