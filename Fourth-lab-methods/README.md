# Task 1.
a) Create a function that takes three numbers. Write "yes" if any of them are the same.
b) Create a function that takes a three-digit number. Switch the first and last digits.

# Task 2.
Create applications with methods for adding and subtracting two values that return the result of the operation. Overload all the created methods so that the accepted values are two integers (first overload), two fractional numbers (second overload), and two strings (third overload). To subtract strings, use the Replace method. Demonstrate how the application works.
